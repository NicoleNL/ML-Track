###---------------- A) Overview --------------------- ###
Consists of 3 modules: 1) Data loading, 2) Data Pre-processing, 3) ML

Framework will load the json data in the data loading module, followed by data preprocessing to clean and remove noise from the text data. With the cleaned data, user can choose to use 
a) unsupervised learning if user wants to classify text data into clusters/groups. Similar texts will be classified into the same cluster. Output will return the text and the cluster number that
   corresponds to the text. Methods that are available: K-means clustering (default), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (optional), Non Negative Matrix Factorization(optional)

b) supervised learning if the data has a target/label for prediction. The text data will be split into train and test. Model building will be done using the train data according to the algorithm
   chosen and evaluated on the test data. Output will return the overall accuracy/classification report(i.e. precision,support,recall,f1-score)/confusion matrix. Algorithms that are available:
   Random Forest(default), Support Vector Machine(optional), Naive Bayes(optional)

c) similarity metrics if user wants to compare the similarity between texts. Methods that are available: Cosine Similarity(default), Jaccard Similarity(optional)
